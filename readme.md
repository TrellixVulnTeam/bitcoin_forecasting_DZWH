## Bitcoin Forecasting

Based on a report by the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0), Bitcoin is surging due to an increase in investor enthusiasm and technology that allow more novice investors to begin trading, while also being a hedge against the dollar due to the global affairs. In this notebook, we investigate further the relationship between these data points and try to fit a model to predict the price of Bitcoin. 

We will use Yahoo Bitcoin History, the data is free to download.
